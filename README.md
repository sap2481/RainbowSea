The Rainbow Sea - A Fishing Survival Game
Catch & Sell Fish to Upgrade Your Ship to Survive the Dangers of the Rainbow Sea!
CONCEPT: A fishing minigame - as a full game. You control a ship sailing upon the Rainbow Sea, casting your line and eventually casting nets and cages to catch bigger and more expensive fish. But the Rainbow Sea is filled with dangers, and you have to be prepared to avoid or evade them (this game has no weapons). Use the money from your catches to repair and upgrade your shipâ€™s hull, maneuverability, and fishing equipment.
